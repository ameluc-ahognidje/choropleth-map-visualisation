# Choropleth Map Project

A small project for visualising data with a choropleth map.

## Stack
- JavaScript
- D3
- CSS

## Functionalities
- Get data from an API,
- Generate a choropleth map from this data

## Installation
1. Open a terminal and clone this repo with the command: `git clone https://github.com/ameluc-ahognidje/choropleth-map-visualisation.git`,
2. Then use this command to go in the cloned folder: `cd choropleth-map-visualisation`,
3. Open the `/index.html` file in your browser

## Updates
I am thinking about moving to React instead of Vanilla JavaScript.

## About
I made this project as part of my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ameluc/data-visualization) curriculum and thanks to it I learned to generate choropleth map to visualise data for useful statistics.
